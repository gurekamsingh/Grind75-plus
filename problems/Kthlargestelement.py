# Problem:
# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array.
# Note: Itâ€™s not the kth distinct, just the kth in sorted order.

class Solution:
     def findKthLargest(self, nums: list[int], k: int):
# Converting nums from index 0 to k into a min-heap, Last leaf node is n/2 +1 and left child is 2*i + 1 and right child is 2*i + 2

        heap  = nums[:k]
        heapq.heapify(heap) # heapify converts list into a min-heap such that smallest element is at heap[0]

        for num in nums[k:]:
            if num > heap[0]: # If the current number is larger than the smallest in the heap, replace it
                heapq.heappush(heap, num) # push the new number onto the heap
                heapq.heappop(heap) # pop the smallest element to maintain size k
