# Grind75-plus
Practicing LeetCode, HackerRank, and system design patterns with clean implementations.

A collection of data structure and algorithm problems I’ve solved for practice.  
All files are located inside the `/problems` directory.  
Each file is named after the core idea or problem being solved.

## How to Use

- Pick a file from `problems/`
- Each file contains the problem description (brief), solution, and inline comments
