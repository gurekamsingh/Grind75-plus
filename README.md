## üìö Contents

- **[problems/](problems/)**:  
  Python implementations of classic DSA problems (arrays, graphs, sliding window, LRU cache, etc.)  
  Each file contains the problem description, solution, and inline comments.

- **[designpatterns/](designpatterns/)**:  
  Notes and Python code for common design patterns (Factory, Observer, Strategy).

- **[systemdesign/](systemdesign/)**:  
  Markdown notes for real-world system design topics (Rate Limiter, Notification System).

- **[DSA-NOTES.md](DSA-NOTES.md)**:  
  Quick reference notes on core data structures and algorithms.
